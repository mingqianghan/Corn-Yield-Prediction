# Corn Yield Prediction
This project focuses on MLCAS Corn Yield Prediction using satellite data. The best results are obtained by averaging predictions from two models: a shallow CNN and a deep CNN. The input features include the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied to each plot, encoded location information, and six spectral bands of satellite images for each plot.
